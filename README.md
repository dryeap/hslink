HS/Link  is a  high speed  file transfer  protocol with  full streaming,
simultaneous  send, receive and CHAT, and advanced Full-Streaming-Error-
Correction(tm).  Each side of  the link is allowed to provide  a list of
files to be  sent.  Files will travel simultaneously  in BOTH directions
until both sides of the link are satisfied.

HS/Link is not just  another bi-directional protocol, it is  also a very
fast protocol  for normal downloading and  uploading, incorporating some
new ideas  (such as  Full-Streaming-Error-Correction(tm),  Dynamic-Code-
Substitution  and Minimal-Blocks(tm)) to make things happen a bit faster
and with greater reliability.
